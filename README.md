# ExamVisionAI

## Overview
ExamVisionAI is a Python-based computer vision system designed to enhance the integrity and management of online examinations. This innovative system uses facial recognition and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to authenticate exam participants and detect potential cheating attempts.

## Features
- **Facial Recognition**: Verifies the identity of exam participants, ensuring that the person taking the test is the registered student.
- **OCR Functionality**: Extracts text from student IDs or other relevant documents for additional verification.
- **Automated Monitoring**: Provides continuous surveillance during exams to detect and report any suspicious activities.

1. **Control Panel (Left Side)**:
   - This area contains the control features of the application. 
   - Here, you can start or stop the monitoring process, adjust settings, and configure the application according to your specific requirements for the examination.

2. **Video Stream (Center)**:
   - The central part of the interface displays a live video stream of the examination.
   - This stream provides real-time visual monitoring of the exam environment.

3. **Data Display (Right Side)**:
   - On the right, the application shows important data and analytics.
   - This includes the results from the facial recognition analysis.
   - The data display is designed to be intuitive, offering at-a-glance insights into the ongoing registration, which helps in quick decision-making and response to any issues that arise.

Together, these components create a comprehensive system for monitoring online examinations, ensuring a fair and secure environment for all participants.
